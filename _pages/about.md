I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist with a background in Biomedical Engineering. 
I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [**Streamion**](https://www.streamion.io/). 
Also, I'm a PhD student at [**Universitat Politècnica de València**](https://www.upv.es/), 
where I'm working on the development of a new _bioinspired_ approach 
for Deep Learning algorithms.

My interests are focused on the development of new Deep Learning algorithms and applications.
